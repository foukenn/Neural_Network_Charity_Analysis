# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
 - Creating a binary classifier neural network that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup Charity.
### Deliverables 
 - Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
 - Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
 - Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
 - Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluation

### Optimization
 - Attempt 1: More neurons were added to both of the hidden layers (140 (layer one) and 80 (layer two). The model accuracy was 72.8% and the loss metric was 56.5%
 - Attempt 2: An extra hidden layer was added. The third hidden layer had a total of 20 neurons (First and second hidden layers were also given extra nodes, 100 and 50 respectively). The model accuracy was 72.7% with a loss metric of 56.6%
 - Attempt 3: The activation function of the hidden layers was changed to tanh and the # of epochs was increased to 150. The model accuracy was 72.8% with a loss metric of 55.8%
